## API Endpoint Overview

### Method Explanation:

#### `POST` Method:
This API endpoint handles HTTP POST requests sent to a specific route. It executes different functionalities based on the provided `action` parameter.

### Action Explanation:

#### `signin`:
- **Purpose:** Handles user sign-in functionality.
- **Operation:** Validates user-provided credentials (room number and last name) against records fetched from a data source (probably a database).
- **Response:** Returns a success status and guest details if the provided credentials match any existing record.

#### `get_plans`:
- **Purpose:** Retrieves available plans.
- **Operation:** Fetches plans from a data source and filters plans based on a specified type (e.g., 'guest_only').
- **Response:** Returns a success status and a list of plans based on the filtering criteria.

#### `connect`:
- **Purpose:** Connects a user based on a selected plan or voucher.
- **Operation:** Retrieves a selected plan or validates a voucher to return the associated plan.
- **Response:** Returns a success status and details of the selected plan or associated plan with the voucher.

Each action within the `POST` method performs distinct operations based on the received request parameters (`action`, `type`, `uuid`, `code`) and data fetched from external sources (e.g., `plansPath`, `voucherPath`). The responses include relevant data or status to indicate the success or failure of the requested operation.
